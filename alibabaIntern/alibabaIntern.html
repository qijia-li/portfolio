        <h2>Introduction<i class="twa twa-lg twa-mega"></i></h2>
        <p>Short videos have played a significant role in B2C platforms to help sellers sell their products on
            e-commerce websites like Taobao, Amazon and etc. 1688, one of the largest B2B ecommerce website, is
            exploring how can short videos
            help to increase sales volumn. </p><br>

        <h2>I worked on<i class="twa twa-lg twa-memo"></i></h2>
        <h5>Redefined the content of short video script for Business Buyers <i class="twa twa-lg twa-shaved-ice"></i>
        </h5>
        <p>I worked with the user research group and analyzed data about the performance of
            short video on the 1688 platform to figure out what are helpful strategies and contents of short videos for
            business buyers, The deliverable will be a website (expected to be launched in late April, 2020) contains
            all the conclusions and scripts for different product departments. </p>

        <h5>Cooperated with ISV to created 100 benchmarking videos<i class="twa twa-lg twa-two-men-holding-hands"></i>
        </h5>
        <p>ISV is a department help sellers on the 1688 platform make short videos for their platform. Cooperation is
            the key to success in the business world. Thus, in order to check our solutions, we cooperated with ISV by
            offering them the scripts they want and they made 100 benchmarking videos for us as reference videos in the
            future. The benchmarking videos show great data performance on the platform, achieving an average 10%
            increment of effective video views. </p>

        <h5>Designed animating stickers and thems for product short videos for Lunar New Year Promotion.<i
                class="twa twa-lg twa-two-men-holding-hands"></i>
        </h5>
        <p>We have the lunar new year promotion which is a good chance to encourage sellers use our strategies to make
            their product videos to gain more data about performance. I designed 4 themes and 16 stickers for product
            shor videos and here is part of them. </p>


        <h2>Takeaways<i class="twa twa-lg twa-baby-bottle"></i></h2>
        <p>There were a number of important lessons I took away from this internship. Some of them I already
            find
            myself considering and integrating into my design practice, two things that stands out most are the
            value of
            data and research. <br><br>
            Data is always important and guide our design. During my experience back in the college, we were not
            able to
            gather enough data to help us make decision. Instead, we used user interview to get qualitative data to
            complement our user research. We tended to make assumption based on our previous experience or others'
            advices. Since there was no business goal or data tracking for our work, as students, we were not able
            to
            learn much from our design.<br><br>

            I also found how important it is to have real users state their needs and test the design.Business users is
            very different from the customers. Designers need to adjust a lot based on their needs</p><br>
